# Docker
Docker is an open-source platform that lets you build, package, and run applications inside lightweight containers.

These containers include:

* Your application

* All required libraries

* Dependencies

* Runtime environment

So the app runs the same way on any system (laptop, server, cloud).

In short:

👉 Docker helps you “build once, run anywhere.”

# Why do we need Docker?

- **Consistency Across Environments** :
Docker packages app + dependencies together, so it runs the same on local, server, and cloud.
Removes “works on my machine” issues.

- **Easy Deployment** :
Applications start in seconds using containers.
No manual setup or configuration required.

- **No Dependency Conflicts** :
All libraries and versions are inside the container.
Avoids clashes between different projects.

- **Lightweight & Fast** :
Containers share the host OS, unlike virtual machines.
Uses less memory and starts much faster.

- **Scalability** :
Multiple app instances can be created easily.
Perfect for microservices and cloud systems.

- **CI/CD Friendly** :
Integrates smoothly with automation tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions.
Helps in continuous testing and deployment.
